          Governments across APAC are phasing out ICE vehicles, while drivers like rising fuel costs, environmental concerns and technological advancements are accelerating the shift toward electrification. The region’s E2W market (e-scooters and e-motorbikes) valued at USD 15.5 billion in 2024 and is expected to reach USD 56.8 billion by 2032, growing at a CAGR of 17.6%, with over 15 million E2W expected on Asian roads within the next few years<sup>[1]</sup>.

          We shall be focusing on the conceptual development of a self-balancing bike in collaboration with our industry partner Red Dot Mobility, that best suits APAC’s dense cities and their unique transportation landscapes and its unique challenges.
        </p>

        <p>
          This includes the research and design of an E2W equipped with an active stabilisation system that keeps it balanced and stable at low speeds and stationary. Unlike traditional bicycles or motorcycles, these bikes use sensors and control algorithms to detect tilts and automatically apply corrective forces, preventing the rider from having to put a foot down during stops or slow maneuvers. This collaborative effort aims to support the development of safer and smarter transportation for city commuting in APAC.

        <h2>2. Problem Definition and Objectives</h2>
        <p>
          The focus of this project is to enhance safety and low-speed stability of e-bikes through self-balancing methods.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- 2.1 Low speed instability -->
      <div id="sub-section-2-header-1">
        <h3>2.1 Low Speed Instability</h3>
        <p>
          Due to the inherent design of a bike, the difficulty riders face in low-speed conditions rises significantly. As speed reduces, effort and steering input correction required to attain stability increases sharply<sup>[5]</sup>. This is a common phenomenon faced by riders in high traffic conditions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore, innovations that can help improve rider safety, including minimising balance loss at low-speeds among riders, are imperative.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- 2.2 Dense traffic -->
      <div id="sub-section-2-header-2">
        <h3>2.2 Dense Traffic</h3>
        <p>
          In traffic-heavy cities like Bangkok, Jakarta, and Mumbai, where the average speed in peak hours is under 25&nbsp;km/h, the convenience offered by bikes are hampered as riders spend nearly half their time balancing between low speeds and a stop-go flow<sup>[6]</sup>. Moreover, this cycle of starting and stopping requires continuous input from a rider to achieve stability, significantly adding to rider fatigue, further exacerbating the safety concerns<sup>[5]</sup>.
        </p>
        <p>
          These have contributed to a rising incidence of motorcycle crashes occurring at low speeds, with over 5% of crashes occurring at impact speeds below 10&nbsp;km/h. Additional factors include decision and perception failures from riders as well as environmental factors like road defects and hazards<sup>[7]</sup>.
        </p>

          “HMW keep an e-bike upright hands-off at 0–10&nbsp;km/h in APAC stop-go traffic, so riders avoid tip-overs and fatigue without adding significant weight or range loss?”
        </p>
        <p>
          We aim to eliminate low-speed instability at less than 10&nbsp;km/h including standstill, via an on-board, active self-balancing system that maintains upright equilibrium without rider input.

        <h3>3.2 Value Proposition Statement</h3>
        <p>
          The IWP self-balancing bike enhances rider safety and comfort by actively stabilising bikes at low speeds (0–10&nbsp;km/h) and at standstill. By automatically detecting and correcting balance deviations through a robust control algorithm and precise angle sensing, the system eliminates the need for continuous rider correction in stop-go traffic, reducing fatigue, minimising tip-overs, and improving overall ride safety and confidence.

      <div id="sub-section-3-header-3">
        <h3>3.3 Objectives and Scope</h3>
        <p>
          For the purpose of this project, the term “bike” collectively refers to bicycles, e-bikes, and e-motorbikes, as they share the common dynamic characteristic of being an inverted pendulum system. This project’s scope comprises the design, development, and testing of a full-scale self-balancing bicycle prototype.
        </p>
        <p>
          The primary objective is to design and validate a self-balancing mechanism capable of maintaining upright stability of a bicycle (with and without rider) at low speeds (0–10&nbsp;km/h) and at rest, through real-time angle detection and corrective actuation. The project will focus on:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Developing a robust control algorithm for balance correction.</li>
          <li>Integrating sensor and actuator systems for precise tilt detection and response.</li>
          <li>Evaluating stability performance, response time, and rider comfort under simulated low-speed conditions.</li>
          <li>Designing a compact system for seamless integration within the existing bicycle frame.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The scope is limited to low-speed stabilisation and does not extend to high-speed dynamics, collision avoidance, or large-scale vehicle integration. The deliverables include system design documentation, control validation through simulations and prototype testing, and performance evaluation against defined stability metrics.

        <h5>Enhanced ABS</h5>
        <p>
          ABS are installed in most motorcycles today, providing better safety and stability in dynamic situations through lean and pitch angle-dependent braking control. Although highly effective at maintaining stability at high speeds and preserving traction during cornering, ABS are less effective at low speeds due to weak sensor signals which may result in unwanted ABS activation<sup>[8]</sup>. As such, most ABS automatically cut-off below speeds of 10–20&nbsp;km/h<sup>[9]</sup>, thus for this project we will not be considering ABS as a low-speed stability method.
        </p>

        <h5>Three-wheeled bikes</h5>
        <p>
          These show improved static stability as well as weave stability over two-wheeled bikes, but in certain situations such as under low-speed, tight-turn conditions, the dynamic behavior (stability and response characteristics) of a three-wheeler becomes very similar to that of a two-wheeler<sup>[10]</sup>. Moreover, three-wheelers deviate from the traditional design and riding experience valued by two-wheeler enthusiasts. In line with this, our industry partner whose product range is centred on two-wheelers intends to pursue stability solutions without shifting towards a three-wheeler configuration.
        </p>

        <h5>AMSAS</h5>
        <p>
          Mechanisms that alter and assist in steering input to provide steering assist input at low speed<sup>[11]</sup> show promise in research prototypes but introduce mechanical complexity and are not yet production-ready. As AMSAS relies on wheel movement and steering to improve stability, it becomes less effective at a stop.
        </p>

        <h5>Gyroscopic systems</h5>
        <p>
          Imbalances are addressed by high-speed rotating discs with gimbal actuation, providing immediate active correction at lower speeds. However, the system consumes a lot of power to maintain the high rotational speeds and precision rates.<sup>[12]</sup>

          The sensing subsystem uses a combination of an IMU and a rotary encoder mounted on the inertia wheel shaft. The IMU measures roll angle and angular velocity<sup>[19]</sup>, while the encoder provides accurate feedback of the wheel’s angular position and speed<sup>[20]</sup>. This configuration offers the best balance between responsiveness<sup>[21]</sup> and signal quality, ensuring low latency and high reliability without introducing significant calibration complexity.
        </p>

        <h5>Control</h5>
        <p>
          A PID controller was selected for the self-balancing system due to its performance, ease of implementation, and stability under variable operating conditions. The controller consists of three nested loops: an inner current/torque loop, a middle velocity loop, and an outer angle loop<sup>[25]</sup>.
        </p>

        <h5>Actuation</h5>
        <p>
          A BLDC motor was selected to drive the inertia wheel due to its high torque density, fast dynamic response, and superior efficiency compared to a BDC motor<sup>[29]</sup>. In a self-balancing application, the ability to generate rapid, precise torque corrections is highly critical.
        </p>

        <h5>Power</h5>
        <p>
          The power subsystem uses an isolated DC-DC converter connected to the main battery of the motorcycle. This allows the self-balancing system to share the existing power source while maintaining electrical isolation from the high-current drive system.
        </p>

        <h5>Mechanism</h5>
        <p>
          The IWP configuration was selected as the mechanical basis of the self-balancing system due to its mechanical simplicity, compact size and well-studied control behaviour (explained in greater detail in Section 5.2). The IWP generates corrective torque by accelerating or decelerating a flywheel mounted along the roll axis, counteracting the lean angle of the bike<sup>[24]</sup>.

        <h4>5.2.1 Inverted Pendulum Model</h4>
        <p>
          A bike is fundamentally an inverted pendulum (Figure&nbsp;7), where its mass M or center of gravity is above its pivot point. The system rotates about the x-axis by a roll angle θ. The various forces acting on the motorcycle are due to weight Mg, normal reaction N and lateral force F<sub>y</sub>. To allow a bike to remain upright (θ ≈ 0), balancing forces need to be continuously applied.

        <p>
          The IWP (Figure&nbsp;9) is chosen due to its relative simplicity to understand, low application complexity and a widely researched topic, making it an ideal starting point for us. The bike model consists of a pendulum and an inertia wheel, both rotating about the x-axis. When the pendulum falls to the side (θ ≠ 0), the angular velocity of the inertia wheel ϕ′ is increased or decreased in the opposite direction to generate a reactionary torque τ to self-balance the system.

        <h5>PID Tuning</h5>
        <p>
          In the context of this self-balancing system, the PID controller receives real-time tilt angle and angular velocity data from the IMU and the motor encoder, and computes the appropriate control signal to drive the BLDC motor. The motor torque output is adjusted to counteract the tilt and maintain balance.
        </p>
        <p>
          The tuning of K<sub>p</sub>, K<sub>i</sub> and K<sub>d</sub> will be performed experimentally to ensure the system achieves fast response, minimal overshoot, and stable balancing performance.
